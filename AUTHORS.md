Brian Musakwa is the sole developer and owner of this software. This project was built with inspiration from **autodoc2**, aiming to enhance the documentation experience in Sphinx.  

## Acknowledgements  
Special thanks to **Guido van Rossum** for creating Python, the foundation that made this project possible.  

## Project Inspiration  
This project was born out of my challenges with rendering **Markdown** and **Google-style docstrings** (`sphinx.ext.napoleon`) in Sphinx. Seeking a more seamless and efficient solution, I decided to develop this package to improve the documentation workflow.
